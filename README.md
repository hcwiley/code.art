<h1>practice powered by art72</h1>
<h4>a place for artist hackers and developers</h4>

<h2>purpose</h2>
<p>Share your sketches, links, code, videos, all in centralized location that ties into github, sourceforge, stackoverflow, etc... but also has a focus on the final piece being created from the process, the practice.</p>

<h2>explanation</h2>
<p>This project, my thesis, is arising from my work on my final installation for senior project. I am dealing with the process of creating a work that is beyond general knowledge.
I am collobrating with a graduate sculpture, Tom LaPann, on an installation that uses some of my software to display his ephemeral nature process based works. He is currently working on the documentation procedure.

By using github in conjunction with youtube/google+ I have been able to document with specific time, location, and comments my progress along the way.
I hope to organize my directories, files, and programs in a logical way so that others may easily mimic the pattern and be able to use practice.art72.org more naturally.
