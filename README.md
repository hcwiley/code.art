<a href='http://code.art72.org' target='_blank'><h1>code.art</h1></a>
<h4>a place for artist hackers and developers</h4>

<h2>purpose</h2>
<p>Share your sketches, links, code, videos, all in centralized location that ties into github, sourceforge, stackoverflow, etc... but also has a focus on the final piece being created from the process.</p>

<h2>explanation</h2>
<p>My thesis deals with the process of creating a work that is beyond general knowledge; by creating code.art I hope to organize my repos, images, and videos in a logical way so that others may easily mimic the pattern and be able to use code.art72.org more naturally.
By using github in conjunction with youtube/google+ I have been able to document with specific time, location, and comments of my progress along the way of creating the installation <a href='https://github.com/hcwiley/riverless-walk' target="_blank">"riverless walk"</a>.
<br>
I am collobrating with a graduate sculpture, Tom LaPann, on an installation that uses some of my software to display his ephemeral nature process based works. He is currently working on the documentation procedure. I am going to get him to use code.art as an initial artist user.
